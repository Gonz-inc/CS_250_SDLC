Software Development Lifecycles 
Gerardo Gonzalez

1.I interpret the user’s needs and use them as features that the user would like to have in the program or application. What helps with this is using User stories, and later using the user’s stories to make story points in order to create a list of tasks to complete in order to complete the user stories. 

2.The approach I take when developing a program is by examining the task and what needs to be done for the user stories. Agile processes that I hope to incorporate into my future are sprint planning, stand-ups, backlog refinement, and continuous learning. All of which will help me become a better team member. 

3.I think that communication, self-organization, and adaptiveness help make a good member of a software development team. Communication is a vital skill that every team will need in order to be a successful team. Self-organization is also very important because this lets team members become self-sufficient and promotes initiative when doing work tasks. Finally, adaptability is also important because if every team member is able to adapt and help take on different roles within the team will ultimately make everyone better and eliminate decencies.
